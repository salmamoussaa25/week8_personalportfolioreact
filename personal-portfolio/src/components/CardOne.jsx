            <p className='myapproachtext'>As a designer specializing in UX/UI Design, I like to tackle the problem first. I enjoy the user research process, looking for the root issue the user faces. Driven by wonder and curiosity, I utilize my experience in strategy and visual storytelling to create user-friendly products that address user needs and align with business goals. Having had the opportunity to learn several design fields and crafts, I like to blend my multi-disciplinary design knowledge in order to create well-rounded and immersive designs and experiences. Being based in Egypt means I get to draw from cultural experiences, build emotional connections to localized target users through relevant experiences, and draw inspiration from a rich culture expressed in our day-to-day life. I am also very passionate about research which makes me a skilled UX researcher. And as someone who was described as empathetic and understanding, I am able to pinpoint user needs and draw conclusions based on data and insights. As someone who struggled with unintuitive applications and laggy websites my entire life, I enjoy being able to shape people’s digital experiences through my work.</p>
